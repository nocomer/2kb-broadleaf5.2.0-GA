# CommunityStarter

This Maven project is a Spring boot implementation of a community [Broadleaf Commerce](http://www.broadleafcommerce.org) application. It has many sensible defaults set up along with examples of how a fully functioning eCommerce site based on Broadleaf might work.

### Running the projects
In general, it's recommended to run via the Spring Boot Maven Plugin `mvn spring-boot:run` or from an IDE.
